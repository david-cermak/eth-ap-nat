# Stubborn WiFi example

This example creates and run standard WiFi station interface, but updates default TCP/IP handlers, in order to keep TCP layer connected on a short-term Wi-Fi disconnection.

TBD... Pros, cons, conservative vs. reactive connection (lazy TCP, eager TCP)

## How it works

TBD... events

## Customization

TBD... TCP options, RTO, nr of retransmit

## Further improvements

TBD... DHCP offer, lease, ...
